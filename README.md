# Scarface.DebugMenu
A simple plugin to enable unused debug menu.

Tested only with executable which is 15544320 bytes large.

You will need Ultimate ASI Loader (https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases), if you use SilentPatch then all you need to do is place the .asi file in main game directory.

A new DEBUG section is added to the in-game menu.
